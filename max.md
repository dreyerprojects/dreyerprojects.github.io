Based in Brooklyn, New York, I am the A1 engineer at Soho House New York, in the meatpacking district. You can hear below some selections from different performances I’ve run sound for, using classic NY mixing techniques and an attitude of care and precision. I'm also available for live sound on appointment, with my own collection of mics & gear.

I also run recording & mixing projects - here are some samples of projects I’ve recorded & mixed for NY musicians. I work in Reaper and Ableton, though I am proficient in Protools. I record at East Side Sound, an excellent hidden live room in Chinatown, and Contusion Studio in Bushwick. I also have a selection of outboard analog processing equipment, and love working with musicians to make mixes sound great, while adding some creative production elements.

Finally, I’m a musician myself - you can find me on Spotify as Dirt Eater, or listen to some of my albums on Bandcamp, following the link below. I'm currently working on a few production projects, as well as recording with my band Die Boskop.
